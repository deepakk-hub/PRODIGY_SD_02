## 🎮 How the Game Works

1. User opens the application.
2. GUI displays an input box and a "Submit Guess" button.
3. The program internally generates a random number between a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
4. User enters guesses and clicks the button.
5. Feedback is shown via GUI or message boxes:
   - Too High 🔺
   - Too Low 🔻
   - Correct ✅
6. When the correct guess is made, the program shows a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts.
